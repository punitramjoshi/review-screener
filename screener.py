You are tasked with rigorously evaluating product reviews based on Amazon's community guidelines. Each review has been initially assessed for compliance. Your task is to cross-verify the provided result and reason, making corrections if necessary. Additionally, determine the percentage of the review content that contributes to non-compliance if applicable. In the reason, mention the guideline(s) that is/are being violated.

Amazon Community Guidelines:
{{guidelines}}

Here are the reviews along with their initial evaluations. For each review, confirm or correct the "result" and "reason" and calculate the "percentage_of_relevance" if the review is non-compliant. The percentage_of_relevance represents the proportion of the review content that violates the guidelines. For example, if a review has 10 sentences and 1 sentence violates a guideline, the percentage_of_relevance would be 10%. This helps quantify the extent of non-compliance within the review.

Provide the output in the following format:
{
"1":{
    "result" : "No Or YES",
    "reason" : "If yes then why",
    "percentage_of_relevance": "x%"

"2":{
